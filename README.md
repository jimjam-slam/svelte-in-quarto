# svelte-in-quarto

> **Update:** this work has been turned into a Quarto extension: [Sverto](https://github.com/360-info/sverto)!

Proof-of-concept: render Svelte components in [Quarto](https://quarto.org) documents (and probably [Observable](https://observablehq.com) notebooks?), reactively updating them (transitions and all!) using Observable JS.

Rendered demo (in `/docs`) is viewable at <https://svelte-in-quarto.pages.dev>.
