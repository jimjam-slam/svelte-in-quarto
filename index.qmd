Okay, so we're using [this blog post on compiling Svelte components as Web Components](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-web-components-svelte), along with with [this SO answer on making Svelte components as browser bundles](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65522522/3246758), to see if we can write Svelte components that can be dropped into plain HTML, or even Quarto documents.

The end goal is to have something that can be instantiated in a Quarto document and then dynamically update its props (using reactive OJS code) without destroying the component - for example, to have a chart that transitions elements as the incoming data changes.

❌ [**The static test**](./test-quarto-static.qmd) aims to use Web Component syntax to drop Svelte components in "statically" with HTML, rather than using JavaScript. Although I got this working, I've abandoned it, as I'm not sure that you can change the props easily, and that's kind of what this is all about.

✅ [**The dynamic test**](./test-quarto-dynamic.qmd) creates a Svelte component and exposes its props. The idea is to create a component, ibject it into an element, then have it update itself when the props are modified _without it being destroyed and remade_. That way Svelte can take care of the updates.
