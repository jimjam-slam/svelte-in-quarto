title: "Svelte components in Quarto (dynamic)"

## Background

Okay, so we're using [this blog post on compiling Svelte components as Web Components](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-web-components-svelte), along with with [this SO answer on making Svelte components as browser bundles](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65522522/3246758), to see if we can write Svelte components that can be dropped into plain HTML, or even Quarto documents.

The end goal is to have something that can be instantiated in a Quarto document and then dynamically update its props (using reactive OJS code) without destroying the component - for example, to have a chart that transitions elements as the incoming data changes.

## Dynamic HTML import

In this second approach, we'll import the module in JavaScript, create an instance, and finally update its props to pass new data in. The hope is that we can cirumvent OJS's reactivity when creating the element, allowing it to transition its child elements (like bars or circles representing data) using its own reactivity. [This notebook uses the same pattern to integrate DeckGL with Observable](https://observablehq.com/@tmcw/using-mapbox-gl-js).

First, let's import the JavaScript. Since OJS blocks are naturally Promises, we should be able to use either `require()` or `await import()`.

```{ojs}
Circles = require("/web-component-tut/public/build/Circles.js");
console.log("First load:", Circles);
```

How'd that go? No? What about `await import()`?

```{ojs}
// CirclesTwo = {
  // const { default: WidgetComponent } =
  // CirclesTwo = await import("/web-component-tut/public/build/Circles.js");
  // return WidgetComponent;
// };

CirclesTwo = await import("/web-component-tut/public/build/Circles.js");
```

Better, I think! Let's create a `CirclesTwo`. I'll create a target `<div>` for it to load into first:

::: {#mycircles style="background-color: #222222;"}
:::

```{ojs}
// console.log("Second attempt:");
console.log("Second load", CirclesTwo);
myCircles = CirclesTwo({
  target: "mycircles",
  props: {
    data: "10|5,30|15,50|25,70|17,90|8"
  }
});
```
